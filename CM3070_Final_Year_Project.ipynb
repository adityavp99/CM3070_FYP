    "Upon examining the results above, it becomes evident that the duplicate movie titles within the dataset correspond to the same year of release. Further personal inspection revealed that these duplicates indeed refer to same movie.  Additionally, a noteworthy pattern emerges where the duplicates with fewer genres consistently have those genres present in the duplicates with the greater number of genres. For instance, the movie <b>Emma</b> with a <b>movieId of 26958</b> is associated with the genre <b>Romance</b>, while its duplicate with <b>movieId 838</b> includes the genres <b>Comedy, Drama, and Romance.</b> This pattern persists across all duplicate pairs, leading to the decision to retain only the duplicate records containing more genre classifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen approach offers several advantages. By retaining duplicates with a higher count of genre classifications, a more comprehensive representation of each movie's thematic content is achieved. This enhanced level of genre information greatly improves the functionality and performance of the recommendation system. It enables more precise genre-based filtering, resulting in nuanced recommendations that cater to diverse user preferences and contextual variations. Furthermore, the inclusion of additional genre labels ensures a more accurate portrayal of a movie's characteristics, as different genres have the potential to appeal to distinct audiences and create unique viewing experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "While recognizing the assumptions and potential biases inherent in this approach, it stands as a logical and practical solution with the available information. Retaining duplicates with a greater number of genre values ensures a more informative dataset for subsequent analyses, optimizing the effectiveness of the recommendation system. This approach remains adaptable to accommodate new insights or adjustments if necessary."

    "The SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model was chosen as the baseline model for this project. The selection of SVD as the baseline model is a suitable choice because it strikes a balance between simplicity and effectiveness.  It goes beyond the straightforward popularity-based approach by incorporating latent factors and capturing underlying patterns in user-item interactions. This allows for a gradual exploration of more complex techniques while establishing a strong foundation for further modeling improvements.\n",

    "The achieved MAE and RMSE scores of the SVD model for both the training and test sets indicate reasonable accuracy in predicting movie ratings. Although further analysis and comparison with other models are required, these results demonstrate the model's ability to capture meaningful patterns in the data and provide meaningful predictions. \n",

    "The create_mask function masks a fraction of the non-zero ratings in the user_item_tensor to emulate missing ratings. This will form the test set and the remaining observed ratings will form the training set. The data is being split into training and test sets in this manner so that the stacked autoencoder can be trained using the entire user-item matrix. The reason that the autoencoder needs to be trained on the entire user-item matrix is because the model is trying to learn latent (hidden) features from the patterns of ratings across all users and items. However, if the data is split into the training and test sets like in the traditional ML methods using the train_test_split method from the scikit-learn library, some of these patterns may be lost. "

    "After modifying the stacked autoencoder model's architecture and training it on the training set for 100 epochs, the model achieved an MAE score of  approximately 0.99 and an RMSE score of 0.99. This implies that the average deviation of the model's predictions from the actual movie ratings is around 0.99 stars. This substantially improved the previous MAE and RMSE scores of 3.78 and 1.94, respectively. \n",

    "There are several advantages of using the TensorBoard visualization tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Visualize Loss Tracking Over Epochs:</b> As shown from the epochs provided, TensorBoard allows us to track the loss as it reduces over successive epochs visually. This graphical representation is instrumental in understanding the training trajectory, and it's evident from epoch 1's loss of 3.0769 to epoch 100's loss of 0.9881 that the model has undergone substantial learning.\n",

However, instead of Keras, PyTorch was employed to construct the architecture. This approach showcases the flexibility and power of PyTorch, making it possible to replicate the advanced structuring capabilities found in Keras' Functional API."

These enhanced metrics indicate that the model's generalization capabilities have significantly improved compared to the previous version. The latest RMSE value suggests a noticably reduced average deviation from the actual ratings when contrasted with the former results. This progress reflects the effectiveness of the modifications made to the model, leading to better prediction accuracy on both the training and test data."

    "A clear pattern emerges after examining the movie suggestions provided by the SVD++ model for user 1. The model seems particularly drawn to movies that were released in the year 1995. What's interesting is that these recommendations span a variety of genres, ranging from lighthearted comedies like \"Father of the Bride Part II (1995)\" to adrenaline-pumping action like \"GoldenEye (1995)\" and even family-oriented adventures like \"Toy Story (1995)\". This diverse selection underscores the model's effort to account for various facets of the user's cinematic interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, regarding the Precision@10 score for user 1, the situation is somewhat mixed. The score of 0.4 signifies that merely 4 of 10 suggested movies genuinely aligned with the user's preferences."

    "Upon delving into the movie suggestions tailored by the RBM model for user 1, an intriguing pattern becomes evident. The model seems to have a pronounced affinity for action-packed films that span the late 70s through the mid-90s. This lineup of suggestions seems to suggest that the user might lean towards narratives containing action and captivating plots, occasionally infused with drama or sci-fi elements. The time period of these releases could also hint at a particular fondness for movies from that era, perhaps tied to nostalgia.\n",
